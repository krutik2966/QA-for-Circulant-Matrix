# QA-for-Circulant-Matrix

"Wan, Lin-Chun, Chao-Hua Yu, Shi-Jie Pan, Fei Gao, Qiao-Yan Wen, and Su-Juan Qin. "Asymptotic quantum algorithm for the Toeplitz systems." Physical Review A 97, no. 6 (2018): 062322"

Inspired by this paper, I have tried to implement Quantum Algorithm for solving the linear equations of Circulant Matrices. Circulant matrix is a common special case of Toeplitz Matrix in which every row of the matrix is a right cyclic shift of the row above it. The implemented algorithm is for 4x4 Circulant Matrix.
